this is a tree

BUT

it's a tree where node utilization can be shared

so functionally each node is a generater that loops and requests more resources
ever N requests



ok so it turns out a tree of generators is super slow

What people seemed to be doing which I like the most is mainting a shared pool
of available resources and ticking it down and reticking it up, which
accomplishes the same thing as a tree of generators but without a million
function calls.
